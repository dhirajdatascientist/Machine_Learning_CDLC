5. **Choosing K**:
   - How can you determine the optimal number of clusters (K) for your dataset?

6. **Convergence**:
   - How does the K-means algorithm determine that it has converged?

7. **Distances**:
   - Which distance metric is commonly used to compute the similarity between data points and centroids in K-means?

8. **Limitations**:
   - What are some limitations of the K-means clustering algorithm?

9. **Code Snippet**:
   - Given the following code, what will be the number of clusters formed?
     ```python
     from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
     kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
     kmeans.fit(data)
     ```
